advt
it's a framework, comes with webpack, routes, animation, etc configured
has aot which reduces the load time
has integrations with 3rd party libs
DI, service worker,2 way binding
davtg
not seo friendly, but we can use universal
big bundle size due to built in modules and zone.js


->DI
-@self
 expects 'providers' to be mentioned in the component
-@optional

->encapsulation
-emulated
  - no shadow dom
  - style encaps
  - value -0
  -default
  -styles are scoped to component
-none
  - no shadow dom
  - no style encaps
  - value -2
  - styles are not scoped to component
  - styles are moved to head
-native
 -shadow dom
 -no style encaps
 -value 1
 style is scoped to the component
 
 
 ->work flow
 angular.json-> main.ts(entry file)it sets the browser env by bootstrapping the appmodule -> app.module -> app.comp.ts -> now it has all files -> index.html
 
 import vs require
 common js
 -require
 -module.exports
 -you can selectively load pieces of lib using require
 -sync
 -require will automatically scan node_modto find mods
 
 ES6
 -import
 -export
 -you can selectively load pieces of lib
 -async
 -we use babel to compile import for that to act as require
 
 life cycle hooks
 -on changes
 -oninit
 -ngdocheck
 -ngcontentinit
 -ngcontentchecked
 -ngviewinit
 -ngviewchecked
 -ngdestroy
 
 
 ang 12
 moving to ivy engine
 no ie11
 strict by default
 supports webpack5
 ng build by default prod
 
 
 ang 13
 node >12.13
 no support for ie11
 ts 4.4
 no implicit override
 webpack cache by default
 
 
 performance
 - use source-map-tool to analyse
 - use required imports
 - lazy load mods
 - use pure pipes instead of functions in components
 if we use getsomething() to display, change detection runs too often and performace degrades. so use pure pipes which gets called only when  its params changes
 -trackby for longlist
 -move initialisation logic to outside angular zone to avoid unnecessary CD. like bar chart mouse movements
 -CD strategy - onpush
 -cdkvirtualscroll

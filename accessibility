1.semantics
aside (like to place share btn to share the current page,this is related to the page)
section (not related to page like a contact info)

2.aria-label
if we have multiple navs or menus we use aria-label so that it reads out the nav purpose to the users

3.skiplink
this is the first link, users with disability can click on it so that it goes to main content

4.use appropriate elements like in the menu, we need to use btn (for drop down with a caret) so that screen readers understand that it's a btn
we can actually use a div to style a dropdown but its not appropriate
use btn to navigate within page and 'a' to navigate to other pages

5.aria
-in case we've to use div to act as a btn use
<div aria-role = button>

6.text-underline is useful so dont remove underline, use text-decoration-color istead

7.use aria-hidden=true for 'decorative images' which has no meaning
8.outline - shows that focussed element using overflow:hidden hides the outline
9.aria-required= true
